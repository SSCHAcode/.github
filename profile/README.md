# SSCHA 2023 School in San Sebastian, Spain (June 26-30)

I am excited to announce that we are organizing a one-week school on the sscha code in San Sebastian, Spain, from June 26-30 2023
The school will provide hands-on sessions focused on the computation of several critical aspects of material science and condensed matter physics, including:

Phase diagrams (first and second-order phase transitions; Ferroelectric and Peierls transitions).

Thermodynamic properties at finite temperature (Entropy, thermal expansion, bulk modulus).

Vibrational spectroscopy (Raman & IR).

Thermal transport in the overdamped regime.

Electron-phonon coupling and superconductivity.

Attending the school will help enrich your toolbox, especially since accounting for anharmonicity in many materials is becoming the new state-of-art is "expected" by papers published in high-profile journals.

Participants can present their research through a poster or an oral presentation. The registration fee for the school is only 150â‚¬ and includes the cost of the social dinner, coffee breaks, and free buffet during the poster session.

San Sebastian is a stunning location, particularly in the summer, with the sea and beautiful beaches.

I encourage you to join us for this excellent opportunity to learn, network, and enjoy the beauty of San Sebastian.
